# Online_Casino_Database
This project is a relational database system developed using PostgreSQL, aimed at simulating the core operations of an online casino. It was created as part of an academic project by a team of five students from DAIICT. The database models essential entities such as customers, employees, games, transactions, and issue handling. The design process involved constructing an ER diagram, converting it into a normalized relational schema, and defining constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

The system includes key features like enforcing primary and foreign key relationships, role-based responsibilities (e.g., only employees with the role of "Issue Handler" can manage reported issues), and structured geographical logic (each city has multiple valid pincodes). The project includes SQL DDL scripts for table creation and DML scripts for populating the tables with 15–20 realistic entries per table. Data was curated to reflect operations in 7–8 major Indian cities, maintaining referential integrity across all records.

The schema was tested with a range of SQL queries to validate relationships and ensure correct behavior under constraints. While the focus of the project is on schema design and data modeling rather than backend code, it effectively demonstrates database normalization, constraint enforcement, and relational design for a moderately complex application. The project lays a strong foundation for potential future integration with web interfaces or application logic.
